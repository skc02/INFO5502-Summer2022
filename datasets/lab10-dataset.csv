Explicit diversification of search results across multiple dimensions for educational search,"We define a new result diversification problem that addresses the typical requirements of a search as learning scenario, that is, where there are a wide range of dimensions the search engine needs to consider when returning results that meet the learning goals (i.e., providing comprehensive information on the topic in many forms (e.g., various types of documents) and at many education levels (e.g., from level 4 to 8)).",JASIST,"Theory proposal

Explicit diversification of search results across multiple dimensions for educational search,"We provide a new framework for diversification, which extends the state_of_the_art diversification methods (namely, xQuAD [Santos, Macdonald, & Ounis, 2010]; a variant of PM2 [Aktolga, 2014] as well as a supervised approach, R_LTR [Zhu, Lan, Guo, Cheng, & Niu, 2014]), to handle multiple dimensions, and provide tailored instantiations for the framework. Specifically, we enrich each diversification method so that while an aspect's coverage in the final ranking is computed, the importance of the dimension which this aspect belongs to is also taken into account. To illustrate our motivation for computing dimension importance values, let an example query be Òtriangle,Ó and assume that the candidate set has documents from all the types available in the system but they all pertain to the education level 4. In this case, the diversification algorithm should focus on diversifying documents w.r.t. The type dimension, since there are several aspects to cover there, but should not attempt to diversify for the education level dimension. Hence, while setting the importance values for certain dimensions adaptively (i.e., per query), we consider the variety of the aspect values observed in the candidate set.",JASIST,Model Construction or Optimization,"Theory proposal

Considering the positive impact of diversified result presentation on the learning outcomes (e.g., knowledge gains of users) as shown in Collins_Thompson, Rieh, Haynes, and Syed (2016) and Syed and Collins_Thompson (2017), these improvements in diversification performance are likely to translate into learning gains in the educational search context, which is the ultimate goal of our present investigation.",JASIST,Performance Evaluation,"Theory proposal

A simple kernel co_occurrence_based enhancement for pseudo_relevance feedback,"First, for better selection and weighting of the QE terms, we present a kernel_function weighting formula consisting of a linear combination of two components. The first component is an effective classic PRF model (that is, the Rocchio model or RM3), which calculates the within_document term weight in a traditional way (that is, the raw term frequency or distribution). The second component can be regarded as a refined version of the PRoc model, which can more effectively capture the proximity information between candidate and query terms in feedback documents. Therefore, the performance of our proposed model can be improved to some extent by adjusting the relative weights between these two components.",JASIST,Model Construction or Optimization,Performance Evaluation,Model Construction or Optimization,
A simple kernel co_occurrence_based enhancement for pseudo_relevance feedback,"Second, we improve the term co_occurrence weight formula in our proposed framework.

However, in our proposed term co_occurrence weight formula, we replace N t with another variant that considers the co_occurrence information in the feedback documents. In other words, we simultaneously incorporate the co_occurrence information into the calculation of the factor of the term discrimination power and the factor of the within_document term weight. Thus, the co_occurrence information is sufficiently utilized in the whole term weight formula to achieve better performance.",JASIST,Model Construction or Optimization,"Theory proposal

Instead, we ask how likely it is that aggregated information contained in that system, and used alone, will support a correct inference as to the actions of a specific targeted user.

Unlike prior studies, we used decision_making theories as a lens to differentiate indicators and criteria. Criteria were defined as high_level abstract rules, and indicators as observable attributes of content or technological platforms. This differentiation enables a two_layered view of quality. The first layer has to do with the content of information on a site and consists of two levels: substance and formality. At the substance level, quality is defined in relation to the accuracy and completeness of the content and is measured against medical textbooks or guidelines. At the formality level, quality is defined in relation to currency, credibility (authoritativeness and trustworthiness), and readability, and is measured by indicators that can be directly observed (e.g., author, copyright, and references). The second layer of quality has to do with the design of a site and consists of two aspects: the technical aspect, including accessibility, aesthetics, navigability, interactivity, and the social aspect, including privacy policy and social and cultural appropriateness.",JASIST,"Theory proposal

"Quality of health information for consumers on the web: A systematic review of indicators, criteria, tools, and evaluation results","Third, this review revealed a wide use of design_related indicators and criteria in evaluation. Compared to earlier studies, which reported that the design_related criteria mainly used were site layout and navigation (Eysenbach et al., 2002), this review revealed that many studies evaluated design in relation to sites' interactivity (e.g., the enabling of information exchanges among users, social media expansion, the presence of internal search engines, and multimedia) and privacy protection (the presence of a policy on the collection and use of personal data). The attention to interactivity may be attributable to the fast development of eHealth research, an emerging area concerning the design and application of interactive technologies to promote health behavior and management (Hesse & Shneiderman, 2007), and the attention to privacy may be attributable to an increasing concern about data security and patients' privacy (Williams, 2010). Another design_related criterion, social and cultural sensitivity, was also found to be evaluated in three studies (Nasser, Mullan, & Bajorek, 2012; Stinson et al., 2011; Wallace, Turner, Ballard, Keenum, & Weiss, 2005). Although all three studies concluded that sites often failed to cater to users' cultural backgrounds, the use of this criterion, nonetheless, indicates an increased recognition among researchers that health information systems are social_technical systems; high_quality systems should not only be accessible and usable, but also attend to users' cultural differences. This recognition is particularly valuable as more countries, communities, and organizations around the world are becoming more ethnically diverse (Nasser et al., 2012).",JASIST,Applications,Model Construction or Optimization,Performance Evaluation,

Effects of domain on measures of semantic relatedness,"The main contribution of this article is demonstrating the hypothesis describedÑthat unlike existing measures that do not explicitly take into account the domains to which the concepts belong, human judges perceive the relatedness between pairs of concepts from different domains significantly lower than those from within the same domains. Of course, one would expect concepts taken from different domains to be generally less related than those from the same domain.

Effects of domain on measures of semantic relatedness,"rowd_sourced human judgments are collected for randomly selected pairs of these concepts.

Note that the human judges were not explicitly made aware of any domain associations of each concept. We later discuss the results of our experimentations in detail. We validate the influence of domain via a different approach: we automatically learn metrics using a range of features and demonstrate that including Domain as a feature significantly improves correlation with human judgments. Overall, the results show that human perceptions of similarity and relatedness are indeed influenced by whether the concepts being compared are from the same domain or from different domains. In other words, humans perceive the strength of association between words from the same domain to be stronger than that from different domains, even without being told that different domains are involved.",JASIST,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,

First, we are interested to explore the impact of a different element of the tagging interfaceÑimage descriptionÑin an unexplored context of image tagging. A combination of nontextual primary content and secondary textual content makes image tagging considerably different from the explored cases. Existing empirical data and tag production models offer conflicting predictions. Imitation models focused on single_user behavior predict that words from descriptions will complement the terms produced by observing images making the resulting tags more diverse. Global tag production models, however, predict a decrease in tagging diversity as a result of exposing all taggers to the same secondary textual content.

The utility of syntax on sentiment analysis is a widely discussed issue, but it has often been focused on long and specific domain reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first article that studies the effect of dependency parsing on Spanish tweets.

"Developing a bottom_up, user_based method of web register classification","One issue discussed in the previous literature is that not all register categories are equally meaningful to end users, and we encountered similar problems in our early rounds of pilot testing. To address this issue, we adopted a hierarchical approach, asking users to identify key situational characteristics of documents, rather than directly identifying specific registers and subregisters. This information was incorporated into our decision_tree survey, which guided raters to a final page with a short list of subregister options. The results show that users are able to reliably agree on register and subregister categories for the majority of documents.

Effects of anchoring process under preference stabilities for interactive movie recommendations,"First, we apply the sequential combinations of collaborative filtering technique to the proposed AHF. We aim to decrease the cold_start and sparse rating problems by aggregating the ratings into the genre level instead of the item level. A genre_based preference modeling, that is, a content_based approach, with the anchoring process is employed in the front_end system to build the user's genre_based profile. Then, a prediction model, that is, genre_based fuzzy inference filtering (G_Fuzzy), is employed in the back_end system to make recommendations. The G_Fuzzy approach is proposed in our previous work, which has proved the approach can reduce the computation time without reducing the precision of the recommendations compared to content_based and collaborative_based filtering approaches (Wu & Hwang, 2013). In this work, we extended the idea in a real movie recommendation circumstance by applying the proposed AHF approach to infer an appropriate starting point for identifying the user's movie preferences for specific genres via a few rounds of iteration.

Effects of anchoring process under preference stabilities for interactive movie recommendations,"Second, we aim to infer the user's preference for movie genres via a series of interactive anchoring processes. Theoretically, we used the AHP (Saaty, 1977) to filter out undesirable movie genres and then identify the user's movie preferences for specific genres. This method is an effective and practical approach that considers complex and unstructured decisions. AHP is considered as an effective approach for calculating the appropriate weights for specific items and ranking them by assessing the relative importance of items (Bena•m, Perennou, Pelissier, & Daures, 2010; Danner et al., 2011; Ishizaka, Balkenborg, & Kaplan, 2011). Ishizaka et al. (2011) have been conducting an experiment to reveal how well AHP fares as a choice support system in a real decision problem in the laboratory. That is, the subjects ranking on items will be identical with the AHP ranking. Furthermore, the AHP approach was considered as an effective approach for preference elicitation in health technology assessment and then decision making (Bena•m et al., 2010; Danner et al., 2011).

Effects of anchoring process under preference stabilities for interactive movie recommendations,"Third, we take the benefits provided by the well_structured technique in Multiple_Criteria Decision Method (MCDM) to infer the user's genre preferences by filtering out undesirable movie genres via a series of pairwise comparison processes and then identify the user's movie preferences for specific genres. Note that the contrast effect of the anchor theory was applied in the AHP model to learn the user's movie preferences during the interactive process. We suggested that the proposed approach would be better than providing a long list of recommendation items and waiting for people to rate them. It also can reduce the cognitive burden via pairwise comparisons when the items are few. In addition, the proposed approach can help the system infer an appropriate starting point for recommending movies via a few rounds of iteration. After obtaining the anchor point of the user, we will utilize the result to calculate the user's genre_based preference and then create the genre_based profile.",JASIST,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,
Effects of anchoring process under preference stabilities for interactive movie recommendations,"Finally, the effects of the anchoring results may be influenced by the users' stabilities of preferences. To investigate the issue of preference stability, we have defined MP types, as introduced in Introduction. The recommendation strategies are designed based on the user's MP type to see if the user's stability for movie genres will influence the recommendation results. We defined the genre_based movie preference types based on Simonson (2005) and Kwon et al. (2009) to extract the user's stability of preference to genres of movies. Researchers in the customer decision_making area pointed out that consumers often do not have well_defined pre_existing preferences that are merely revealed when they make choices among available products or services (Bettman, Luce, & Payne, 1998). In this work, we measured the user's preference stability based on the user's variants of movie genres, which are introduced as follows: (a) Stable Preference: When the users have stable preferences, they are highly predictable if their preferences are revealed well (Kwon et al., 2009). Accordingly, we could infer the users' movie preferences based on their previous records. Both the pure genre_based (content_based) filtering and the AHF approaches would be effective. (b) Unstable Preference: It is difficult to customize the offers for the users who have unstable preferences (Kwon et al., 2009). Thus, the personalized content_based filtering approach would not be suitable for this type of user (Arora et al., 2008). Therefore, a more elaborate approach to predict users' movie genre preferences is required. The proposed AHF approach may lead to a much better effect on recommendation results with people who have unstable preferences for movie genres.",JASIST,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization,Performance Evaluation,

Understanding engagement with the privacy domain through design research,"Our first contribution is to reveal a set of challenges in relation to how privacy interventions are currently being designed. Many interventions have relied on extrinsically motivating technology users to attend to privacy matters through the threat of potential consequences, while at the same time offering authoritative solutions that diminish users' agency. As a consequence of this, we found that technology users had formed expectations that privacy risks can be handed over to technologies. Such expectations were also fuelled by their inertia with respect to privacy, present even among those reporting to be most privacy concerned. Moreover, we found that technology users made sense of a privacy risk through a broad but yet consistent inquiryÑranging from attaining an understanding of the nature of the risk, to the responses that were available to them.

Such results suggest that the facilitative influence of the Internet might be effective for research collaboration among scholars from different academic fields, but could be less effective for scholars from different countries. The lack of enhancement effect for international collaboration could be because of reasons specific to the field of IS, such as highly internationally mobile scholars, or strong international research communities, and so on.

How are people enticed to disclose personal information despite privacy concerns in social network sites? The calculus between benefit and cost,"First, privacy concerns that inhibit giving information to SNS cannot be solved by solely approaching the problem from the point of view of privacy itself. This is not to suggest that SNS providers should ignore the proper installation of means for privacy control and related policies. Many people worry about the safety of their privacy, which will only increase as the amount of information required for better service and using various embedded applications increases. However, as the aforementioned survey by Harris Interactive and Westin (2008) and our additional analysis have shown, privacy concerns do not exist in inverse proportion to privacy controls: There is a limit to how comfortable privacy safeguards can make people feel. Therefore, SNS providers need to approach users' concerns from different angles and consider adding various features that can operate as enticements rather than focusing just on factors that mitigate privacy concerns. In designing SNS, these enticements can be reinforced by strengthening and adding new functions of SNS that correspond to the behavior enticements identified here. For example, if an SNS embeds the function of analyzing all the content that users have left in postings and replies and provides an up_to_date view of a user's self_image mirrored in the space of SNS, the internalization enticement will be more powerful. For technology to draw users, it should go beyond its users' obvious needs and expectations and offer value and connections relevant to its users' personal goals (Khaslavsky & Shedroff, 1999). Therefore, rather than overly focusing on institutional safeguards to protect users' privacy, accommodating those enticements with the unique set of technological features will help SNS providers attract more users who seek to suit their needs in SNS.",JASIST,"Theory proposal

We also examine the impacts of regulatory compliance on agency satisfaction with support services, an important form of organizational support for the effective use of e_government systems.

The MIREX grand challenge: A framework of holistic user_experience evaluation in music information retrieval,"The article contributes theoretically to MIR evaluation. The holistic user_experience evaluation approach advocated and implemented in this study is a radical revolution from existing evaluation frameworks including MIREX, MediaEval, and CLEF (discussed later). These existing frameworks focus on subtasks related to components of MIR systems rather than on complete ones. In addition, they largely follow the Cranfield paradigm (Voorhees, 2002), where retrieval systems are compared against common test collections with topics/queries, materials/collections, and relevance/similarity judgments. Putting users and their interactions with complete MIR systems in the center of consideration changes the entire perspective. The evaluation infrastructure no longer consists of predefined queries or ground truth; the evaluation context is shifted from simplified laboratory settings to real_world scenarios; and the evaluation criteria focus on users' interactions and perceptions. Hopefully, the proposed evaluation framework will inspire more studies on holistic user_experience evaluation in MIR.",JASIST,"Theory proposal

C_sanitized: A privacy model for document redaction and sanitization,"In comparison with available models (Anandan et al., 2012; Cumby & Ghani, 2011), which assume that all risky terms (sensitive entities or related terms) have been identified a priori, our proposal automatizes both the detection of terms that can disclose sensitive data via semantic inferences and their protection. This relieves human sanitizers from manually identifying related terms, which has been identified as one of the most difficult and time_consuming challenges (Bier et al., 2009; Gordon, 2013). To do so, our model considers, as human sanitizers do, the semantic relationships by which terms or combinations of terms appearing in a document would disclose sensitive information via semantic inferences.

Moreover, the privacy criterion can be set using intuitive linguistic labels rather than abstract numbers. As a result, the model can be easily and straightforwardly instantiated according to current legislations and regulations on data privacy (Department for a Healthy New York, 2013; Department of Health and Human Services, 2000; Health Privacy Project, 2013; Legal Information Institute, 2013; Terry & Francis, 2007; European Parliament and the Council of the EU, 1995), whose rules are also expressed linguistically (e.g., disease names, locations, etc.).
